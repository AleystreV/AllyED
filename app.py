Trained on the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), our model uses the information you enter in the sidebar to predict whether a student might be at a higher risk for depression, suicidal thoughts, physical bullying, and cyberbullying. You can also generally toggle the options to see how different factors affect the probability of various student risks.")
